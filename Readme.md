# Home Tutor

Home Tutor is a website made with the intention of connecting students to teachers who live near them and teach the subjects in which a student needs personal attention/ tutoring. This will help in finding good tutors for the students and will also create some employment prospects for the teacher. The website has following salient features:
1. A sign up form for teachers and students.
2. A login for teachers and students. 
- Students can login with their username and password. On logging in, students can see the teachers who live in the same city as them and teach the same course. Student can take download a pdf of this list by clicking on the print button. Students can also enroll to a teacher by clicking the enroll button. Then students will be redirected to a payment page where they can pay the fees. There is also a provision to apply for reimbursement, where 50% fees will be returned to the student if the reimbursement request is approved.
- The teacher can see in his/her login the details of the students who have enrolled to him/her. \
There is a donate page where the anonymous donors can donate any amount to the website using payment gateway. This will be used to provide reimbursement(financial aid) to the students. 
3. The admin can see the total donated amount, number of donors and financial aid requests of the students through his login.
4. There is also a statistics page where students can compare the fees of all the tutors on the website via a bar graph, their teaching experience using a pie chart and see the locations of different teachers on a map.
